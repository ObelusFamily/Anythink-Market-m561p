## First setup

<!-- **[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_ -->

Make sure you have docker install in your system download from here [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

- You can verify docker is ready by running the following commands in your terminal: `docker -v` and `docker-compose -v`
- Next run `docker-compose up` from the project root directory,this will load Anythink's backend and frontend.
- If Docker is working correctly, the backend should be running and able to connect to your local database.
  - Let's test this by pointing your browser to http://localhost:3000/api/ping

- Now, let's check frontend and make sure itâ€™s connected to the backend.
  - If everything is working properly, youâ€™ll be able to create a new user on http://localhost:3001/register
  - Create one (choose a cool nickname and everything) and youâ€™ll be able to move to the next step.
- Just make sure that you run all scripts in the next quests on one of the containers created by `docker-compose up`.  Also, you can use `docker exec` to run commands on a running container.

It looks like your environment is ready! ðŸ˜€
